//! CONTEXT
//! -------
//!
//! So far, you have seen context-free web applications in Rust. These web applications
//! do not share context with a higher level or between themselves.
//!
//! While appropriate for very simple applications, most real world applications will need
//! some form of context. For example, a web application might need to access a database,
//! and it would be inefficient to open a new connection to the database for every request.
//! So most handlers will end up drawing from a database connection pool.
//!
//! Axum has been designed to facilitate sharing context, both between handlers, and
//! between handlers and higher levels of the application.
//!
//! In this section, you will explore these mechanisms.
//!

/// EXERCISE 5
///
/// The type `S` flows through a lot of the types in Axum (Router, MethodRouter,

///
/// What happens if your handlers, from different parts of your application,

/// One possible solution to this problem is to make your handlers polymorphic
/// in the type of state they handle, and to use traits that expose "accessors"
/// for the specific state type they require.
///
/// In this exercise, you will use this technique to complete the following
/// exercise.
///
/// Assume that some handlers require state type `GBPtoUSD`, and that other
/// handlers require state type `EURtoUSD`. Further, assume you have a
/// composite state type, `AllExchangeRates`, that contains both `GBPtoUSD`
/// and `EURtoUSD`.
///
/// Invent traits that can describe what each type of handler requires from
/// the "global state", and then make the handlers polymorphic in the state
/// type, requiring only an implementation of the appropriate trait.
///
/// You might have to supply some type hints to the compiler in order to
/// construct the routes with your polymorphic handlers.

/// a modular web application, where different types of endpoints have

/// EXERCISE 6
///
/// Although it is possible to share virtually any kind of context using State,
/// with the appropriate type classes and polymorphic handlers allowing state
/// to vary across a web application, some would prefer to reduce the amount of
/// ceremony required to share varying context, and are willing to accept a
/// tradeoff in terms of static type safety.
///
/// For this audience, Axum has a solution called Extensions. Extensions can be
/// used to share context between middleware and handlers, or just to share
/// context either between handlers, between middleware, or between either
/// handlers or middleware and higher levels of the application.
///
/// In order to use extensions, your handler may require a parameter of type
/// `axum::extract::Extension<T>` where `T` is the type of the context you
/// wish to share. Then you must install a layer in your router, which holds
/// the context, and you can do that with the `Extension(...)` constructor.
///
/// In this exercise, you will implement the same exchange-rate-sharing
/// application, but this time using an extension to share state.
