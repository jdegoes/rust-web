//! One of the main things that web servers do is talk to other web servers. This usually
//! takes the form of HTTP requests.
//!
//! In this section, you will see how you can "talk" to other web servers using Reqwest,
//! a popular HTTP client for Rust. Because Reqwest supports Tokio, it integrates
//! nicely into your Axum web applications.
//!

///
/// EXERCISE 1
///
/// In this exercise, you will make a web app that retrieves a random cat fact
/// from `https://catfact.ninja/fact` and displays it to the user in HTML.
///
/// In order to use Reqwest with json, you need to enable the `json` feature
/// (which is already enabled in this project). You then use one of the
/// reqwest methods, such as `reqwest::get`, to make a request. This
/// returns a future that can be awaited, and which returns a result
/// that may contain an error. If the result is successful, then using the
/// `json` feature, you can call the `json` method on the response to
/// deserialize the response into any type T that implements `serde::Deserialize`.

/// EXERCISE 2
///
/// In this exercise, you will make a web app whose feature set is powered by

/// The supported API endpoints are:
///
/// GET 	/posts
/// GET 	/posts/1
/// GET 	/posts/1/comments
/// GET 	/comments?postId=1
/// POST 	/posts
/// PUT 	/posts/1
/// PATCH 	/posts/1
/// DELETE 	/posts/1
///
/// Your job is to create an Axum web app that supports the following routes:
///
/// GET /posts
/// GET /posts/:id
/// GET /posts/:id/comments
/// POST /posts
/// PUT /posts/:id
/// DELETE /posts/:id
///
/// You have been provided with the structs Post and Comment, which you can use
/// to for interacting with the API using Reqwest.
///
/// You will have to use use a Reqwest client to make requests to the API.
/// One has been provided for you in the `posts_server` function. You can
/// set the body of a request using the `.body` method.`
